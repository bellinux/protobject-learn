# Coding with Protobject  

Protobject uses **visual blocks** for programming, based on **Blockly**, making it easy for users to create interactive projects **without writing code**. Since Protobject is designed around block-based programming, it is **not directly compatible with JavaScript**.  
However, for those who want to develop projects using JavaScript, we provide **Protobject Framework**, which allows you to create and extend projects with JavaScript while leveraging the capabilities of Protobject.
